# Collect-the-Apples-Game
This is a collect the apples game co-developed in a team of 3 as part of a Microprocessor Group project in C. The game involves the player controlling a person on screen and collecting as many apples without touching any bombs. Every three apples a new bomb spawns. This is made for a microprocessor on a breadboard. The main.c holds all of the program code to make the game work. I created the game logic such as the functions that check if the player has collected a bomb,spawning a new bomb when 3 apples are collected and checking if the person has hit a bomb and ending the game.
